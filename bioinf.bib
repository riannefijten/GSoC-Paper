Abstract = {{Background: Biological pathways are a useful abstraction of biological
   concepts, and software tools to deal with pathway diagrams can help
   biological research. PathVisio is a new visualization tool for
   biological pathways that mimics the popular GenMAPP tool with a
   completely new Java implementation that allows better integration with
   other open source projects. The GenMAPP MAPP file format is replaced by
   GPML, a new XML file format that provides seamless exchange of graphical
   pathway information among multiple programs.
   Results: PathVisio can be combined with other bioinformatics tools to
   open up three possible uses: visual compilation of biological knowledge,
   interpretation of high-throughput expression datasets, and computational
   augmentation of pathways with interaction information. PathVisio is open
   source software and available at http://www.pathvisio.org.
   Conclusion: PathVisio is a graphical editor for biological pathways,
   with flexibility and ease of use as primary goals.}},

Title = {{WikiPathways: building research communities on biological pathways}},

Abstract = {{Here, we describe the development of WikiPathways
   (http://www.wikipathways.org), a public wiki for pathway curation, since
   it was first published in 2008. New features are discussed, as well as
   developments in the community of contributors. New features include a
   zoomable pathway viewer, support for pathway ontology annotations, the
   ability to mark pathways as private for a limited time and the
   availability of stable hyperlinks to pathways and the elements therein.
   WikiPathways content is freely available in a variety of formats such as
   the BioPAX standard, and the content is increasingly adopted by external
   databases and tools, including Wikipedia. A recent development is the
   use of WikiPathways as a staging ground for centrally curated databases
   such as Reactome. WikiPathways is seeing steady growth in the number of
   users, page views and edits for each pathway. To assess whether the
   community curation experiment can be considered successful, here we
   analyze the relation between use and contribution, which gives results
   in line with other wiki projects. The novel use of pathway pages as
   supplementary material to publications, as well as the addition of
   tailored content for research domains, is expected to stimulate growth
   further.}},
