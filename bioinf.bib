Title = {{Presenting and exploring biological pathways with PathVisio}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biological pathways are a useful abstraction of biological
   concepts, and software tools to deal with pathway diagrams can help
   biological research. PathVisio is a new visualization tool for
   biological pathways that mimics the popular GenMAPP tool with a
   completely new Java implementation that allows better integration with
   other open source projects. The GenMAPP MAPP file format is replaced by
   GPML, a new XML file format that provides seamless exchange of graphical
   pathway information among multiple programs.
   Results: PathVisio can be combined with other bioinformatics tools to
   open up three possible uses: visual compilation of biological knowledge,
   interpretation of high-throughput expression datasets, and computational
   augmentation of pathways with interaction information. PathVisio is open
   source software and available at http://www.pathvisio.org.
   Conclusion: PathVisio is a graphical editor for biological pathways,
   with flexibility and ease of use as primary goals.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we describe the development of WikiPathways
   (http://www.wikipathways.org), a public wiki for pathway curation, since
   it was first published in 2008. New features are discussed, as well as
   developments in the community of contributors. New features include a
   zoomable pathway viewer, support for pathway ontology annotations, the
   ability to mark pathways as private for a limited time and the
   availability of stable hyperlinks to pathways and the elements therein.
   WikiPathways content is freely available in a variety of formats such as
   the BioPAX standard, and the content is increasingly adopted by external
   databases and tools, including Wikipedia. A recent development is the
   use of WikiPathways as a staging ground for centrally curated databases
   such as Reactome. WikiPathways is seeing steady growth in the number of
   users, page views and edits for each pathway. To assess whether the
   community curation experiment can be considered successful, here we
   analyze the relation between use and contribution, which gives results
   in line with other wiki projects. The novel use of pathway pages as
   supplementary material to publications, as well as the addition of
   tailored content for research domains, is expected to stimulate growth
   further.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB, http://www.hmdb.ca) is a richly
   annotated resource that is designed to address the broad needs of
   biochemists, clinical chemists, physicians, medical geneticists,
   nutritionists and members of the metabolomics community. Since its first
   release in 2007, the HMDB has been used to facilitate the research for
   nearly 100 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and
   systems biology. The most recent release of HMDB (version 2.0) has been
   significantly expanded and enhanced over the previous release (version
   1.0). In particular, the number of fully annotated metabolite entries
   has grown from 2180 to more than 6800 (a 300\% increase), while the
   number of metabolites with bio-fluid or tissue concentration data has
   grown by a factor of five (from 883 to 4413). Similarly, the number of
   purified compounds with reference to NMR, LC-MS and GC-MS spectra has
   more than doubled (from 380 to more than 790 compounds). In addition to
   this significant expansion in database size, many new database searching
   tools and new data content has been added or enhanced. These include
   better algorithms for spectral searching and matching, more powerful
   chemical substructure searches, faster text searching software, as well
   as dedicated pathway searching tools and customized, clickable metabolic
   maps. Changes to the user-interface have also been implemented to
   accommodate future expansion and to make database navigation much
   easier. These improvements should make the HMDB much more useful to a
   much wider community of users.}},

Title = {{The BridgeDb framework: standardized access to gene, protein and
   metabolite identifier mapping services}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many complementary solutions are available for the
   identifier mapping problem. This creates an opportunity for
   bioinformatics tool developers. Tools can be made to flexibly support
   multiple mapping services or mapping services could be combined to get
   broader coverage. This approach requires an interface layer between
   tools and mapping services.
   Results: Here we present BridgeDb, a software framework for gene,
   protein and metabolite identifier mapping. This framework provides a
   standardized interface layer through which bioinformatics tools can be
   connected to different identifier mapping services. This approach makes
   it easier for tool developers to support identifier mapping. Mapping
   services can be combined or merged to support multi-omics experiments or
   to integrate custom microarray annotations. BridgeDb provides its own
   ready-to-go mapping services, both in webservice and local database
   forms. However, the framework is intended for customization and
   adaptation to any identifier mapping service. BridgeDb has already been
   integrated into several bioinformatics applications.
   Conclusion: By uncoupling bioinformatics tools from mapping services,
   BridgeDb improves capability and flexibility of those tools. All
   described software is open source and available at
   http://www.bridgedb.org.}},
